<h2>The Importance of Being Earnest A Trivial Comedy for Serious People</h2>
<h4>Algernon Moncrieff’s Flat in Half-Moon Street, W.</h4>

    ALGERNON.
    Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?
    
    LANE.
    I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.
    
    ALGERNON.
    I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can
    play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the
    piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.
    
    LANE.
    Yes, sir.
    
    ALGERNON.
    And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber
    sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?
    
    LANE.
    Yes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]
    
    ALGERNON.
    [Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the
    way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
    Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
    champagne are entered as having been consumed.
    
    LANE.
    Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
    
    ALGERNON.
    Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
    drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.
    
    LANE.
    I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often
    observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a
    first-rate brand.
    
    ALGERNON.
    Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?
    
    LANE.
    I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little
    experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married
    once. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and
    a young person.
    
    ALGERNON.
    [Languidly_._] I don’t know that I am much interested in your family
    life, Lane.
    
    LANE.
    No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it
    myself.
    
    ALGERNON.
    Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.
    
    LANE.
    Thank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]
    
    ALGERNON.
    Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders
    don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They
    seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.
