    <p class = "speech"> you hear what I was playing, Lane? </p>
    
    <h5 class = "name LANE">LANE.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.</p>
    
    <h5 class = "name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <p class = "speech"> I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can
    play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the
    piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.</p>
    
    <h5 class = "name LANE">LANE.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Yes, sir.</p>

    <h5 class = "name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber
    sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?</p>
    
    <h5 class = "name LANE">LANE.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Yes, sir.</p> 
    <p class = "stage-direction">[Hands them on a salver.] </p>
    
    <h5 class = "name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <p class = "stage-direction">[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] </p>
    <p class = "speech">Oh! . . . by the
    way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
    Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
    champagne are entered as having been consumed.</p>
    
    <h5 class = "name LANE">LANE.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.</p>
    
    <h5 class = "name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
    drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.</p>
    
    <h5 class = "name LANE">LANE.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often
    observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a
    first-rate brand.</p>
    
    <h5 class = "name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?</p>
    
    <h5 class = "name LANE">LANE.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little
    experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married
    once. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and
    a young person. </p>
    
    <h5 class = "name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <p class = "stage-direction">[Languidly_._] </p>
    <p class = "speech">I don’t know that I am much interested in your family
    life, Lane. </p>
    
    <h5 class = "name LANE">LANE.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it
    myself. </p>
    
    <h5 class = "name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you. </p>
    
    <h5 class = "name LANE">LANE.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Thank you, sir.</p>
    <p class = "stage-direction">[Lane goes out.] </p>
    
    <h5 class = "name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders
    don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They
    seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility. </p>
